# transferdash
Simple test dashboard for making transfers using the Paystack Transfers API

Running a Node.js backend concurrently with a React.js frontend.

To test it out locally, clone this repo
```git clone git@github.com:tkalejaiye/transferdash.git```

and create a .env file to store your bearer token from your Paystack dashboard

```bearer:"your_secret_key"```

run ```npm run dev``` in the root directory to start. The server will run on port 8000 and the client on 3000
